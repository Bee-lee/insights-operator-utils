// Package metrics contains all metrics that needs to be exposed to Prometheus
// and indirectly to Grafana. Currently, the following metrics are exposed:
//
// api_endpoints_requests - number of requests made for each REST API endpoint
//
// api_endpoints_response_time - response times for all REST API endpoints
//
// api_endpoints_status_codes - number of responses for each status code
//
